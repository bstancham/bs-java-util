#+TITLE: BS-JAVA-UTIL

* Introduction

/bs-java-util-version:/

A collection of mostly obsolete Java utilities. Mostly a bit pointless but still
here because I have at least one major project which depends on some of this
stuff.

* Compilation

Build program, run tests and copy jar file to ~/lib:

: $ gradlew all

Build documentation:

: $ gradlew javadoc
